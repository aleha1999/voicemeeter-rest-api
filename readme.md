# A mega janky VoiceMeeter REST API
This is a rest API for voicemeeter that lets you do things.

Among "things" are
* Set gain
* Get gain
* Fade devices
* Get index of sounds in a sounds directory
* Play sounds in the sounds directory
* Stop sounds
* Yes, it comes with a soundboard
* Mute, unmute, toggle tracks

That's about it. Have fun figuring out how to use it because this is a janky thing I made on my own and can't be bothered to document. Oh, and the API has zero standardisation in request formats or responses... so... yeah... have fun.

There are probaly other, much better solutions out there, this is just custom to my use. If you have any good suggestions leave an issue, I don't mind. Just don't expect a timely response, or for anything to be done about it.

Okay, bye ❤️
